MazarineBlue is a automation framework, containing an interpreter that
reads instructions and data from a source and is extendable though
custom build modules. Several modules are included that allow, among
other things, data extraction from excel and other sources, web browser
interaction and data driven testing.

## Commit messages

A commit message should be helpfull for reviewing. It's when a commit
message is helpfull for reviewing that git blame, revert, rebase, log
shortlog and other subcommand come to life. It's when a commit message
helpt you to understand *what* was changed and *why* that reviewing
becomes possible and efficient. A commit message is helpfull for
reviewing when it complies with the following simple rules:

1. Separate subject from body with a blank line;
2. Limit the subject line to around 50 characters;
3. Capatalize the subject line;
4. Do not end subject with a period;
5. Use the imperative mood in the subject line;
6. Wrap the body at 72 characters;
7. Use the body to explain *what* and *why*;

The subject should give the reader a overview on what the commit does.
Therefor it should be short and use imperative mood. Imperative mood
means "spoken or written as if giving a command or instruction". A
properly format git commit subject should be able to complete the
following sentence: if applied, this commit will..."

The body must explain on the *what* was changed and *why*. A helpfull
message provides context to the changes that are in the commit. Answer
the following questions:

- Why was this change necessary?
- How does this change address the issue?
- What side effects does this change have?

This project comes with a commit template. Please activate it by running:  
```git config commit.template .gitmessage.txt```

The format looks like this:

> Summarize changes in around 50 characters or less
>
> More detailed explanatory text, if necessary. Wrap it to about 72
> characters or so. In some contexts, the first line is treated as the
> subject of the commit and the rest of the text as the body. The
> blank line separating the summary from the body is critical (unless
> you omit the body entirely); various tools like `log`, `shortlog`
> and `rebase` can get confused if you run the two together.
> 
> Explain the problem that this commit is solving. Focus on why you
> are making this change as opposed to how (the code explains that).
> Are there side effects or other unintuitive consequenses of this
> change? Here's the place to explain them.
> 
> Further paragraphs come after blank lines.
> 
>  - Bullet points are okay, too
> 
>  - Typically a hyphen or asterisk is used for the bullet, preceded
>    by a single space, with blank lines in between, but conventions
>    vary here
> 
> Include a references to the issue tracker like this:
> 
> Resolves: #123  
> See also: #456, #789

## Tips and Tricks
- You can set your default editor with
  ```git config -global core.editor vim```

- And you can add the following to your ```~/.vimrc``` to add spell
  checking and automatic wrapping at the recommended 72 columns to you
commit message:

  ```
  autocmd Filetype gitcommit setlocal spell textwidth=72
  ```
